This is a simple [Sinatra](https://www.sinatrarb.com) app that's 
deployable to [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and can act as a [logging bridge](http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/configuration/configuring-centralized-logging-from-javascript/) for 
[Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com). 

It uses [sinatra-cross_origin](https://github.com/britg/sinatra-cross_origin) to support CORS.
